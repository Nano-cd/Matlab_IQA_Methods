The BPRI quality measure:
function [BPRIp,BPRIc] = BPRI(img)
Input:  (1) img: test image
Output: (1) BPRIp: the quality score computed by the probability weighting strategy (default)
        (2) BPRIc: the quality score computed by the hard classification strategy
Usage:  Given a test image img, whose dynamic range is 0-255
        [BPRIp,BPRIc] = BPRI(img);

The PSS blockiness measure:
function score = PSS(img)
Input : (1) img: test image
Output: (1) score: the blockiness score
Usage:  Given a test image img, whose dynamic range is 0-255
        score = PSS(img);

The LSSs sharpness measure:
function score = LSSs(img)
Input : (1) img: test image
Output: (1) score: the sharpness score
Usage:  Given a test image img, whose dynamic range is 0-255
        score = LSSs(img);

The LSSn noiseness measure:
function score = LSSn(img)
Input : (1) img: test image
Output: (1) score: the noiseness score
Usage:  Given a test image img, whose dynamic range is 0-255
        score = LSSn(img);
